<blockquote>“The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There
comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will,
and the solution comes to you and you do not know how or why.
All great discoveries are made in this way”

Explore in more detail the structure and
composition of Deep Learning systems. As previously defined, Deep
Learning is a Connectionist approach to Artificial Intelligence. Deep
Learning specifically employs multiple layers of components arranged
in a graph without loops. There can be many kinds of layers but the
common property on any layer is that it is differentiable. This is a
consequence of the learning mechanism (i.e. gradient descent).
<h2>Unknowable Knowns</h2>
One good way to frame the question of the limits of Deep Learning
is in the context of the Principle of Computational Equivalence by
Stephen Wolfram. Wolfram showed that simple cellular automations
are able to exhibit complex behavior that cannot be predicted from
initial conditions or the simple rules that specify its incremental
behavior. Certain kinds of cellular automata can exhibit complex
behavior that cannot be reduced to a mathematical model that
captures its behavior in closed form. Wolfram examples of an
‘irreducible’ system that exhibits this complex behavior are the brain
and weather systems. Wolfram classifies these kinds of systems as
exhibiting “Universality” [WEW].
A Deep Learning system that has memory belongs to this class of
universal machines, however this does not imply that these systems
can replicate the behavior of another universal machine. Bernhard
Scholkopf reveals this conclusion in a paper “Towards a Learning
Theory of Cause and Effect" [LPD]. That is, a learning system is
able only to derive the cause while observing the effect. This tells
you that a Learning system can't learn the mechanisms of say, how a
DNA manufactures specific proteins. A fundamental limitation of
any system that learns from data is that it cannot predict effect from
cause. This theory is analogous to the “Halting Problem” in
Computability Theory.
One criticism that I hear often about Deep Learning is that it doesn't
capture the biological mechanisms of the brain. This is a fair
criticism. However, Wolfram’s Universality explains why it should
not be a major issue toward achieving AGI. Deep Learning systems
can possibly have equivalent capabilities as a biological brain albeit by
using different computational mechanisms. At the fundamental level,
all these systems are computational systems that exhibit three
building blocks. That is, computation, memory and signaling.
Complex behavior is an emergent behavior that, like cellular
automata, arises from very simple rules.
A useful schema in understanding the capabilities of a system to learn
or discovery unknowns can be stated as follows:
Knowable knowns, meaning models that will converge on training
data. Knowable unknowns, are trainable models that are able to
make accurate predictions on non-training data. Unknowable
knowns, reflects an inability to learn a known system, this covers the
area of performing predictions of other irreducible universal
machines. Unknowable unknowns is the inability to discover what
a machine does not know. We break this down in more detail:
<ol>
<li> Knowable Knowns - Given a large enough set of knowns (i.e.
training data) we can get good convergence of our prediction errors.</li>
<li> Knowable Unknowns - This is an expression of the concept of
generalization. With good generalization, we can know about test
data that a machine has never encountered in its training set.</li>
<li> Unknowable Knowns - However, there are certain classes of
system that deep learning can never learn. These are in the class of
computational irreducible systems. However a Deep Learning system
may detect the direction of causality and be able to know that is able
to learn from the system. What it will not be able to know
(unknowable) is if a system is in the class of computational
irreducible systems.</li>
<li> Unknowable Unknowns - Finally, there is a class of total
ignorance. This is really a metaphysical statement. The class of
unknowables that cannot be known is unknowable. Think of it as the
“Great Firewall” of knowledge.</li>
