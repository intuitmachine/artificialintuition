							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<blockquote>“The revolution in deep nets has been very profound, it definitely
surprised me, even though I was sitting right there.”
- Sergey Brin
</blockquote>
<p>
Coursera co-founder and Stanford adjunct professor Andrew Ng
spoke recently about AI transforming industry:
<blockquote>
AI is the new electricity. Electricity transformed industries: agriculture,
transportation, communication, and manufacturing. I think we are now
in that phase where AI technology has advanced to the point where we
see a clear path for it to transform multiple industries. Just as electricity
transformed industry after industry 100 years ago, I think AI will do
the same.	
</blockquote>

AI has been around since the 1950s, it has gone through several
boom and bust cycles. In the last five years however, a new kind of
AI called Deep Learning has unexpectedly emerged. Since 2012 it
has been delivering spectacular and surprising results. Many people
see the progress but don’t realize the catalyst. Previous AI failures,
the ambiguity regarding what AI means and the newness of this
emerging technology are all making it difficult for people to
comprehend what is occurring.
This problem is further exacerbated by mass media that continues to
dole out sensational articles that exhibit boom and gloom. The press
either writes about capabilities that are outside the realm of what is
feasible or a far-in-the-future scenario that is in the realm of science fiction. This is compounded with the constant drumbeat of
spectacular research results coming from academe and industry.
Indeed, a lot of excitement is coupled with mass confusion.
Deep Learning is an unexpected revolution in artificial intelligence.
Google’s founder, Sergey Brin was complete caught by surprise and
this is a person who should be finally in tune with the latest computer
science developments. I suspect 99% of the world’s population has
never even heard of the term ‘Deep Learning’. Even if they have,
they likely would have the slightest clue as to what it is about.</p>
							
						<h2>A New Kind of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
						<p>
							Peter Thiel uses a phrase, “The Last Company Advantage” [COM].
Although you don’t necessarily need to have the “First Mover
Advantage”, but you absolutely want to be the last company standing
in your business. So Google may be the last Search company,
Amazon may be the last E-Commerce company, and Facebook will
hopefully not be the last Social Networking company. What keeps
me awake at night though is that Deep Learning could in fact be the
“Last Invention of Man”!
However, let’s ratchet it down a little bit. Kurzweil’s Singularity
(estimate is 2045) is after all still 3 decades away. That’s still plenty of
time for us humans.
I quote from a recent interview of Ray Kurzweil which reveals that in

“A.D. 2035: Rich people will be thousands of times smarter than
poor people” [KOE]:
<blockquote>
	Right now, let’s say that you can personally afford to spin up 1,000
Amazon instances, for argument’s sake. Elon Musk can spin up one
million, perhaps. And maybe Bill Gates can spin up 100 million.	
</blockquote>


Deep Learning is a technology that is as revolutionary as the Internet
and mobile computing that came before it.
The current revival of interest in all things “Artificial Intelligence”
(AI) is primarily due to the spectacular results achieved with DeepARTIFICIAL INTUITION
5
Learning research. I must however emphasize that this revival is not
due to other classical AI technologies like expert systems, semantic
knowledge bases, logic programming, or Bayesian systems. Most of
classical AI has not changed much, if any, in the last 5 years. The
recent quantum leap has solely been driven by Deep Learning
successes. Many venture capitalists like to cling to the term AI, but
these days, the term has become meaningless [BOG].
